<div class="about">
  <p>The Wilke Lab carries out research in computational evolutionary biology, bioinformatics, and structural biology.
    All our research is theoretical or computational, but we frequently collaborate with experimental groups. Much of
    our research addresses questions of molecular evolution, in particular about the evolution of viruses and the
    biophysical mechanisms of protein evolution. Other areas of interest are systems biology, metabolic modeling, and
    biostatistics. </p>
